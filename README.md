# Scripture Earth

[ScriptureEarth.org](https://scriptureearth.org) (SE.org) is a website that provides a source for accessing Scripture resources in thousands of languages (3215 Scripture resources as of 7/2024) through text, audio, and video for speakers of minority languages. SE.org does not publish extra Biblical materials (like Bible studies) in the minority languages (but there are limited exceptions).

## Description

### Primary and Secondary Audiences

**The primary target audience** is speakers of minority languages to access Scripture for the speakers of the minority languages whether living in the homeland or as part of the diaspora. The primary audiences may be indirectly served by **other people and organizations** (the secondary audience) who would like to receive these resources to pass it on to the primary target audience.

### Strategy and Goal

**The strategy** of the SE.org website is to provide actual primary language Scripture resources in ways that are simple and easy to transfer from the repository to the user. **The goal** is for a user to easily find their language page and note the kind of resource by the form of icons.

### Simplest Possible Way

In our primary target audience we have noticed that in most of the Central and South America locations the Internet connections are inconsistent or the Internet bandwidth is frequently low. The objective is to provide Scripture resources in the simplest way possible that is accessible even in less than ideal Internet locations. We have been very careful to use the fonts, text, and images for the SE.org layout to be more sparse, simple, and streamlined than all of the other Scripture websites.

### The Scripts

This repository contains most of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL (MariaDB), and AJAX for the SE.org website. In addition, it contains the “add” and “edit” for the CMS.

If you are the user of SE.org, scripts are divided up into two sections: 1) the searches for the minority languages page, and 2) the specific minority language page.

## Search For and Display Specific Minority Languages Page

### Searches For the Minority Languages Page
